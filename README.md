# Mock server for Sensors data

This mock server allows mocking sensors data (temperature [7 - 23Â°C] and humidity [50 - 100%]) depending on season and day hours.
30-days time series are produced hourly. It might be updated in future for more variable and parameters.

Server runs on port 3001 by default.

Routes are :
```
/info
/temperature
/humidity
```

Once installed on local machine, API is reachable at http://localhost:3001/humidity .
